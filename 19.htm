Stuttering most often is initiated between the ages of 2.5-4.5. This age is 
critical both for speech development and the onset of stuttering. Rarely 
stuttering appears later, at the school age; in adolescents and adults 
stuttering begins in exceptional cases. What factors determine the stuttering 
origin and why does one child stutter but another does not? Many speech 
therapists and physicians know well about the incidents when a sudden fright 
initiates the stuttering onset. Everyone undergoes stress in childhood, but only 
a few children, being frightened of a terrible dream, scary dog or an 
unexpectedly loud sound begin to stutter. Therefore, unexpected fright provoking 
this disorder in most cases cannot be considered as the reason for stuttering. 
There exist some risk factors, which initiate stuttering onset after a definite 
provoking stressful incident.</span><span style="color: #333300"> &nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Bookman Old Style; color: #333300">The 
present study was carried out in an attempt to reveal the preconditions of this 
disorder. With this purpose, 60 stuttering persons between the ages of 2.4 to 24 
were examined and questioned. Data about conditions immediately preceding and 
accompanying stuttering onset were obtained from the patients, relatives and 
individual medical case histories. Our findings were as following: In the <b>
1st. group,</b> 24 participants had continuous close contact with stuttering 
relatives in speech formation period. Stuttering origin coincided with the 
speech initiation. Most likely the children began to stammer imitating 
stuttering speech. In the <b>2nd. group</b>, 36 participants had fluent speech 
period until the stressful accident initiating stuttering. Thirty three of them 
had asphyxia neonatorum in anamnesis, 30 had increased cranial pressure during 
first life months, and 36 had muscle tone disturbances. Children of the 2<sup>nd</sup> 
group distinguished by fidgety (28), disturbances of sleep (26), appetite, and 
digestion (30). Parents reported about fatigability (27), restlessness (29), 
irritability (29) and timidity (30) of their children. &nbsp;Between the ages of 1.5 - 6, every child survived stress - sudden fright- and began to stutter just 
after this incidence or during the next 2 weeks. In most cases, children were 
frightened by dogs, physicians, and darkness. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt;line-height:
150%"><span style="font-family: Bookman Old Style; color: #333300">In a healthy 
child, the same events could not induce stress and stuttering. The incidents 
inducing stuttering in children without birth trauma must be substantially more 
serious. For example, a 13 year-old girl witnessed and spent the night near the 
dead body of her mother; a 6 year-old girl got into a bombardment; a 4-year-old 
boy endured painful procedures during 20 days after his surgery. Despite crying 
and attempting to free himself, he was forcibly immobilized by hospital nurses. 
These children began to stutter, although none of them had stuttering relatives 
or endured a birth-trauma. It is quite possible that increased sensibility and 
timidity of children, who endured asphyxia neonatorum, transforms some events of 
life into supraliminal irritants that evoke strong stress. This is exactly why 
not every child began to stutter after the sudden fright, but only those who had 
certain psychoneurologycal peculiarities because of an endured birth trauma. The 
complex of neurological and behavioral characteristics of a child after a birth 
trauma makes stuttering very probable after a strong stress. Thus, we suppose 
the asphyxia neonatorum is one of the most important, but not exclusive, risk 
factors of stuttering.</span></p>
