<span style="font-family: Bookman Old Style; color: #333300">Asphyxia neonatorum 
is the most widespread birth-trauma.&nbsp; Asphyxia results in a sharp blood-filling 
and perivascular edema in a newborn's brain. Brain edema can raise the 
intracranial pressure to such degree that it may considerably increase the 
pressure in brain vessels. As a result, perfusion pressure is falling and 
insults begin to develop. Numerous investigators reported about abnormal brain 
development in 20-90% of children who endured severe asphyxia. 
Pathomorphological studies showed that hemorrhages provoked by asphyxia was 
diffuse and evenly distributed not only in different brain regions, but in other 
organs and tissues as well. Pyramidal cells in the neocortical motor area are 
most sensitive to asphyxia, which is the reason for motor disturbances. Brain 
circulation failure includes hemorrhages, ischemic and hemorrhagic infarcts 
which are localized in brain white matter too. As a result, occurs the 
disturbance of myelinization of the nervous fibers. In 90% of one-year-old 
children who endured medium and severe asphyxia, the pathological EEG activity 
in the form of sharpened waves and spike-wave complexes was recorded (Solovyeva, 
1971). In the EEG of such children, Elizarova (1977) observed hypersynchronized 
slow waves, focal spike-wave complexes, and equivalents of epileptiform seizures. 
Different intracranial hemorrhages are thought to be one of the reasons of 
seizures. Convulsive activity in the central nervous system is manifested in 
tremor, seizures, and tone disorders from the first days of life. Muscle 
spasticity and hyperkinesis were observed in cases of severe (6-10 minutes) 
asphyxia (Elizarova, 1977).</span></p>

<span style="font-family: Bookman Old Style; color: #333300">We examined 20 
preschool age children (3-6 years) with birth-trauma (asphyxia neonatorum) in 
anamnesis. During conversation it was revealed that 15 mothers had pregnancy 
pathology, labor was induced because of poor labor activity (n=5), ranging from 
4 to 38 hours (n=15) with complications (n=12). As a result, 14 of the patients 
endured asphyxia neonatorum and 3 had fetal hypoxia in anamnesis. Subsequently, 
children had increased cranial pressure (n=11) and muscle tone disturbances (n=16) 
during the first year of life. Parents noted anxiety behavior in the first 3 
months (n=17); children often cried without apparent reason (n=16), had 
difficulties in falling asleep (n=17); disturbances in sleep (n=17), appetite 
and digestion (n=14) were observed. Children demonstrated aggressive reactions (n=6), 
allergic reactions (n=9) and susceptibility to respiratory illness (n=16). 
Parents reported about hypersensitization, irritability (n=17) and timidity (n=11) 
of their children.</span><span style="color: #333300"> </span>

the </span><span style="font-family: Bookman Old Style; color: #333300">
examination, we revealed a physical development delay (n=12), muscle tone 
disturbances (n=17), speech (n=14) and mental (n=8) development delays, 
concentration and attention impairment (n=14), undue fatigability (n=9) and 
restlessness (n=11). So we consider the presence of certain psychoneurologic 
characteristics in a preschool child (excitability, timidity, rapid fatigability, 
restlessness, irritability and aggressiveness) as the evidence of endured birth 
trauma, asphyxia neonatorum.</span></p>
