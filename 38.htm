&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although typically described in many neuropsychiatric disorders, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors also occur in normal children. Stereotypic repetitive behavior characterizes by compulsive purposeless involuntary movements. In this investigation the behavior modification with negative reinforcement of pathologic behavior used as therapeutic tool for the suppression of stereotypic movements in school age children.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventeen boys, ages 4 to 9 years, with different stereotypic movements (body rocking, hand shaking, waving, etc.) were divided into two groups. Individual sets of exercises were developed for every patient. The exercise programme represented static isometric exercises with resistance and intended for strengthening of muscles participating in pathological movements. During 20 days subjects from 1 group (n=8) performed their exercises twice a day for 0.5 hour each time.  Children from second group (n=9) performed exercises during 5 -10 minutes immediately after each manifestation of abnormal motor activity. To the end of the experiment number of involuntary pathological movements in first group reduced by half. In second group 6 children completely got rid of their pathological habits. 3 children from second group performed their exercises irregularly: only after 60%-85% of all pathological movement. As a result, the number of abnormal movements in these subjects decreased by 30%-70%. It appeared that static exercises strengthen muscles participating in pathological activity thereby raising the thresholds of neuromuscular excitation. Consistent application of static resistive exercises in the capacity of negative reinforcement of pathological movements completely eliminates stereotypic repetitive behavior.<br>
